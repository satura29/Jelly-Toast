This is the game Jelly Toast, under the 2DPlatformer Game title. It was originally a project.
There may be some bugs and some errors in the following:

Not dying due to timer
Sometimes stomping on a stompable enemy still kills you

And some quality of life stuff that can be improved:

Fishes need a more gentle pull down
ON/OFF switch should have a proper animation.

Please fix when you have the chance.
